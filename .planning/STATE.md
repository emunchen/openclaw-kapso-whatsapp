# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-01)

**Core value:** Audio messages from WhatsApp users reach OpenClaw as usable text — transparently, reliably, with graceful fallback if transcription fails.
**Current focus:** Phase 4: Reliability

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 4 (Reliability)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase (04-01 complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-03-01 — Plan 04-01 complete: no_speech_prob guard, debug logging, config fields (Debug/NoSpeechThreshold/CacheTTL), INFR-01 verified

Progress: [████████░░] 77%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 2min
- Total execution time: ~0.03 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 2 | 4min | 2min |
| 03-integration | 2 | 9min | 4.5min |
| 04-reliability | 1 | 3min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2min), 04-01 (3min)
- Trend: Consistent

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Pre-work]: Groq/OpenAI share one implementation via configurable BaseURL — no duplicated HTTP code
- [Pre-work]: [voice] prefix on transcribed text distinguishes it from typed text in the relay pipeline
- [Pre-work]: Graceful fallback to [audio] (mime) — transcription failure must never cause message loss
- [Pre-work]: No Google Cloud STT — avoids heavy SDK, inconsistent with minimal deps principle
- [01-01]: MaxAudioSize validated non-zero in Validate() to guard TOML zero-value masking defaults
- [01-01]: Provider env var auto-lowercased in applyEnv() for case-insensitive user input
- [01-01]: Empty provider is valid config state — transcription disabled by default, not an error
- [01-02]: Stub-crash pattern for cloud providers — New() errors at startup if configured before Phase 2 exists
- [01-02]: maxBytes passed as DownloadMedia parameter (not stored on Client) — keeps Client stateless re: transcription config
- [01-02]: io.LimitReader(body, maxBytes+1) sentinel avoids reading full oversized response while detecting overflow
- [01-02]: local provider validates binary via exec.LookPath at startup, not at transcription time
- [02-01]: openAIWhisper uses CreatePart+textproto.MIMEHeader (not CreateFormFile) — CreateFormFile hardcodes application/octet-stream, rejecting audio files
- [02-01]: w.Close() called explicitly before request construction — defer leaves buffer incomplete
- [02-01]: audio/opus normalized to audio/ogg in NormalizeMIME — Kapso sends codecs param, Whisper needs base type
- [02-01]: verbose_json response format chosen — richer metadata at no extra cost vs plain json
- [02-02]: deepgramProvider.BaseURL field overridable in tests — avoids global URL constant, keeps struct self-contained
- [02-02]: retryTranscriber.sleepFunc injectable for zero-delay tests — same pattern as mockable now() from Phase 1
- [02-02]: factory_internal_test.go as separate internal-package file — allows type assertion on unexported *retryTranscriber
- [02-02]: isRetryable returns false for nil and non-httpError errors — non-HTTP errors (network failures) not automatically retried
- [03-01]: No retry wrapper on local provider — local subprocess failures are not transient; retrying wastes CPU
- [03-01]: MkdirTemp + RemoveAll over individual CreateTemp — single cleanup call handles all intermediate files atomically
- [03-01]: execCmd function field injectable (same pattern as now()) — lets tests intercept both ffmpeg and whisper-cli without real binaries
- [03-01]: ffmpeg validated in factory LookPath, not in newLocalWhisper — struct constructor focuses on config validation
- [03-01]: whisper-cli -otxt flag writes to outputPrefix.txt — reading stdout would risk buffering issues
- [03-02]: context.Background() passed to Transcribe — provider-level timeout (30s) is sufficient; no separate pipeline timeout needed
- [03-02]: WARN log on each failure step (GetMediaURL, DownloadMedia, Transcribe) — silent fallback, message never lost
- [03-02]: transcribe.Transcriber interface type in test struct (not *mockTranscriber) — avoids Go interface nil pitfall where (*T)(nil) != nil interface
- [03-02]: Fallback calls formatMediaMessage which does its own best-effort GetMediaURL — double call accepted for simplicity in non-critical fallback path
- [04-01]: noSpeechError is unexported — delivery layer catches via errors.As, not string match
- [04-01]: Empty segments array skips no_speech guard — short silent clips have no segments; rejecting them would be incorrect
- [04-01]: providerName() derives from BaseURL string match — avoids adding a provider name field just for logging
- [04-01]: Guard uses maxNoSpeech (worst segment) not average — one bad segment indicates noise in clip
- [04-01]: gofmt applied to pre-existing unformatted test files as part of bulk fmt fix

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Groq rate limits under load — exact audio-seconds-per-minute limit unknown; plan for 429 handling without confirmed threshold
- [Phase 2]: Deepgram response nesting (`results.channels[0].alternatives[0].transcript`) RESOLVED — dedicated test in deepgram_test.go validates with real fixture
- [Phase 3]: Kapso `AudioContent` struct fields (`.ID`, `.MimeType`) inferred from codebase — verify against actual webhook payload before implementing audio branch
- [Phase 3]: whisper.cpp `--output-txt` CLI flag stability is MEDIUM confidence — validate against installed binary version before implementing local provider

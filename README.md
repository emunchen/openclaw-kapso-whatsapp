# openclaw-kapso-whatsapp

Give your [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) AI agent a WhatsApp number.
Official Meta Cloud API via [Kapso](https://kapso.ai) — a unified API for WhatsApp Cloud. No ban risk.
Stateless. Two Go binaries. Near-zero idle CPU.

## Architecture

```
WhatsApp --> Kapso API --> kapso-whatsapp-bridge --> OpenClaw Gateway --> AI Agent
   ^                                |
   +--------------------------------+
          relay: reads session JSONL, sends reply back
```

Three delivery modes: **polling** (zero-config), **Tailscale Funnel** (auto-tunnel), or **your own domain**.

## No ban risk. No phone emulation.

Libraries like Baileys and whatsapp-web.js reverse-engineer WhatsApp Web — Meta actively detects and bans these connections. This bridge uses the **official Cloud API** through Kapso, so your number stays safe.

- **Stateless API calls** — no persistent connections, near-zero idle CPU
- **No session management** — nothing to keep alive or reconnect
- **Lower power footprint** — ideal for home servers and laptops
- **Works with any OpenClaw agent** — just drop in SKILL.md

## Quick start

No config file. No database. No reverse proxy.

```bash
export KAPSO_API_KEY="your-key"
export KAPSO_PHONE_NUMBER_ID="your-phone-number-id"
kapso-whatsapp-bridge
```

That's it — polling mode works with zero configuration. To cut latency to under 1 second, see [Tailscale Funnel mode](#tailscale-funnel-zero-config-tunnel).

## Installation

### Go install

```bash
go install github.com/Enriquefft/openclaw-kapso-whatsapp/cmd/kapso-whatsapp-cli@latest
go install github.com/Enriquefft/openclaw-kapso-whatsapp/cmd/kapso-whatsapp-bridge@latest
```

Copy the agent skill definition into your OpenClaw workspace:

```bash
cp skills/whatsapp/SKILL.md ~/.openclaw/skills/whatsapp/SKILL.md
```

### Prebuilt binaries

Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Enriquefft/openclaw-kapso-whatsapp/releases).

### NixOS / Home Manager

<details>
<summary>Nix flake + home-manager setup (includes sops-nix support)</summary>

```nix
# flake.nix
inputs.kapso-whatsapp = {
  url = "github:Enriquefft/openclaw-kapso-whatsapp";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
};
```

Then in your home-manager config:

```nix
imports = [ inputs.kapso-whatsapp.homeManagerModules.default ];

services.kapso-whatsapp = {
  enable = true;
  package = inputs.kapso-whatsapp.packages.${pkgs.system}.bridge;
  cliPackage = inputs.kapso-whatsapp.packages.${pkgs.system}.cli;
  secrets.apiKeyFile = config.sops.secrets.kapso-api-key.path;          # or any file path
  secrets.phoneNumberIdFile = config.sops.secrets.kapso-phone-number-id.path;
};
```

The module generates `~/.config/kapso-whatsapp/config.toml`, installs the CLI, and creates a systemd user service. Secrets are read from files at startup — works with sops-nix, agenix, or plain files.

</details>

## Configuration

The [Quick start](#quick-start) covers the minimum: just two env vars. Everything else has sensible defaults.

<details>
<summary>Full config reference</summary>

Create `~/.config/kapso-whatsapp/config.toml` (or set `KAPSO_CONFIG` to a custom path):

```toml
[kapso]
api_key = ""              # prefer KAPSO_API_KEY env var for secrets
phone_number_id = ""      # prefer KAPSO_PHONE_NUMBER_ID env var

[delivery]
mode = "polling"          # "polling" | "tailscale" | "domain"
poll_interval = 30        # seconds (minimum 5)
poll_fallback = false     # run polling alongside webhook as safety net

[webhook]
addr = ":18790"
verify_token = ""         # prefer KAPSO_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN env var
secret = ""               # prefer KAPSO_WEBHOOK_SECRET env var

[gateway]
url = "ws://127.0.0.1:18789"
token = ""                # prefer OPENCLAW_TOKEN env var
session_key = "main"
sessions_json = "~/.openclaw/agents/main/sessions/sessions.json"

[state]
dir = "~/.config/kapso-whatsapp"
```

**Loading order:** built-in defaults → config file → env vars. Environment variables always win, so existing setups work unchanged.

### Secrets (env vars)

These are the only values you typically need to set as env vars:

| Variable | When needed |
|---|---|
| `KAPSO_API_KEY` | Always |
| `KAPSO_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` | Always |
| `KAPSO_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` | Tailscale or domain mode |
| `KAPSO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Domain mode (optional, HMAC validation) |
| `OPENCLAW_TOKEN` | If gateway auth is enabled |

All other settings have sensible defaults and belong in the config file if you need to change them.

</details>

### Security

The bridge enforces sender allowlisting, per-sender rate limiting, role tagging, and session isolation. By default, security mode is `allowlist` — only phone numbers listed in `[security.roles]` can interact with the agent.

#### Config file

```toml
[security]
mode = "allowlist"                    # "allowlist" | "open"
deny_message = "Sorry, you are not authorized to use this service."
rate_limit = 10                       # max messages per window per sender
rate_window = 60                      # window in seconds
session_isolation = true              # per-sender sessions (false = shared)
default_role = "member"               # role for unlisted senders in "open" mode

[security.roles]
admin = ["+1234567890"]
member = ["+0987654321", "+1122334455"]
```

Each role maps to a list of phone numbers. The agent receives a `[role: <role>]` tag in every forwarded message, enabling role-based capability enforcement in SKILL.md.

#### Environment variables

For simple setups without roles:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `KAPSO_SECURITY_MODE` | `"allowlist"` or `"open"` |
| `KAPSO_ALLOWED_NUMBERS` | Comma-separated phone numbers (all get `default_role`) |
| `KAPSO_DENY_MESSAGE` | Message sent to unauthorized senders |
| `KAPSO_RATE_LIMIT` | Max messages per window per sender |
| `KAPSO_RATE_WINDOW` | Rate limit window in seconds |
| `KAPSO_SESSION_ISOLATION` | `"true"` or `"false"` |
| `KAPSO_DEFAULT_ROLE` | Role for senders not in the roles map |

If a number appears in both `KAPSO_ALLOWED_NUMBERS` and the TOML `[security.roles]`, the TOML role wins.

#### Behavior

- **Allowlist mode** (default): Only numbers in `[security.roles]` can send messages. Unauthorized senders receive the deny message.
- **Open mode**: Anyone can send. Senders not in the roles map get `default_role`.
- **Rate limiting**: Fixed-window token bucket per sender. Excess messages are silently dropped (no response to avoid amplification).
- **Session isolation** (default on): Each sender gets their own OpenClaw session (`main-wa-<number>`), preventing cross-sender context leakage.

### Delivery modes

#### Polling (default)

Works out of the box — no public endpoint, no domain, no tunnel. Polls every 30 seconds with up to 30s latency on incoming messages.

```
kapso-whatsapp-bridge  --poll-->  Kapso REST API
       |                               |
       |  (new messages)               |
       v                               |
  OpenClaw Gateway  --reply-->  kapso-whatsapp-cli  -->  Kapso API  -->  WhatsApp
```

No extra config needed — just set the two required env vars.

#### Tailscale Funnel (zero-config tunnel)

Real-time delivery (< 1s latency) without owning a domain. The bridge starts [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) automatically and prints the webhook URL to register in Kapso. Tailscale Funnel works on the free plan.

```
Kapso webhook POST  -->  https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net/webhook
                               |  (tailscale funnel, auto-started)
                          Webhook server (:18790)
                               |
                          OpenClaw Gateway  --reply-->  Kapso API  -->  WhatsApp
```

**Prerequisites:** Tailscale installed and running (`tailscale up`), HTTPS certs enabled (`tailscale cert`).

**Config diff from defaults:**

```toml
[delivery]
mode = "tailscale"
```

Plus set `KAPSO_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN`.

#### Your own domain

If you have a domain with HTTPS (behind nginx, Caddy, or Cloudflare), point your reverse proxy at the webhook server.

```
Kapso webhook POST  -->  https://yourdomain.com/webhook
                               |  (reverse proxy -> :18790)
                          Webhook server (:18790)
                               |
                          OpenClaw Gateway  --reply-->  Kapso API  -->  WhatsApp
```

**Config diff from defaults:**

```toml
[delivery]
mode = "domain"
```

Plus set `KAPSO_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN` (and optionally `KAPSO_WEBHOOK_SECRET` for HMAC validation).

Register `https://yourdomain.com/webhook` as the webhook URL in Kapso.

> **Polling fallback:** Any webhook mode can also run polling as a safety net by setting `poll_fallback = true`. Messages are deduplicated by ID.

## Voice transcription

Incoming voice notes are automatically transcribed and forwarded as `[voice] <transcript>` — the AI agent sees text, not an audio file. If transcription is not configured or fails, the message is forwarded as `[audio] (audio/ogg)` instead. No messages are ever lost.

### Cloud providers

Set a provider and API key — that's it.

```toml
[transcribe]
provider = "groq"           # "groq" | "openai" | "deepgram"
api_key = ""                # prefer KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_API_KEY env var
```

| Provider | Default model | Base URL |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| `groq` | `whisper-large-v3` | `api.groq.com/openai/v1` |
| `openai` | `whisper-1` | `api.openai.com/v1` |
| `deepgram` | `nova-3` | `api.deepgram.com/v1` |

Groq and OpenAI share the same implementation (configurable `BaseURL`). All cloud providers include automatic retry on 429/5xx (3 attempts, exponential backoff).

### Local provider (whisper.cpp)

No API costs. Requires [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) and ffmpeg installed.

```toml
[transcribe]
provider = "local"
binary_path = "whisper-cli"          # path to whisper-cli binary
model_path = "/path/to/ggml-base.bin"
```

Audio is converted from OGG to WAV via ffmpeg before processing. Temp files are cleaned up automatically.

### Full config reference

```toml
[transcribe]
provider = ""               # "groq" | "openai" | "deepgram" | "local" (empty = disabled)
api_key = ""                # API key for cloud providers
model = ""                  # override default model per provider
language = ""               # language hint (empty = auto-detect)
max_audio_size = 26214400   # max download size in bytes (default 25MB)
binary_path = "whisper-cli" # local provider only
model_path = ""             # local provider only
timeout = 30                # per-call timeout in seconds (cloud providers)
no_speech_threshold = 0.85  # silence detection — above this, falls back to [audio]
cache_ttl = 3600            # transcript cache lifetime in seconds (SHA-256 keyed)
debug = false               # log avg_logprob, no_speech_prob, detected language
```

### Environment variables

Every field has a `KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_` env var override:

| Variable | Field |
|----------|-------|
| `KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER` | `provider` |
| `KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_API_KEY` | `api_key` |
| `KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL` | `model` |
| `KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_LANGUAGE` | `language` |
| `KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_MAX_AUDIO_SIZE` | `max_audio_size` |
| `KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_BINARY_PATH` | `binary_path` |
| `KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_MODEL_PATH` | `model_path` |
| `KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_DEBUG` | `debug` |
| `KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_NO_SPEECH_THRESHOLD` | `no_speech_threshold` |
| `KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_CACHE_TTL` | `cache_ttl` |

Minimal cloud setup with env vars only:

```bash
export KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER="groq"
export KAPSO_TRANSCRIBE_API_KEY="your-key"
```
